Reginaldo - Ho pianto per lui
=========
*Reginaldo* is an advanced, modular and multi-platform (*citation needed*) clipboard manager.

*At least these are my own intentions ´_ゝ｀*

How to use
----------
Just run it and do what you do usually.

When you want to take an old paste from the history, just press at the same time
`LEFT SHIFT` + `F1...F12`, and it will be loaded in your clipboard.

Configuration
-------------
You'll find all the customizable parameters in `include/reginaldo/config.h`.

Simply open the `Rakefile` and append your definitions to `CFLAGS` prefixing `-D`.
